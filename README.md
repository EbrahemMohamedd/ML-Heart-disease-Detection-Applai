A Detailed Explanation of My Thought Process During the Development of This Model
First, I needed to analyze the dataset to understand the unique samples and overall data structure. This step was crucial in selecting the most suitable machine learning models for the task. I quickly identified that a classification model was necessary since the dataset contained a target column labeled ‘target.’ Moreover, given that the data came from the medical field—where disease identification is a key application—classification models were the most appropriate choice.

Next, I began the preprocessing phase, applying various techniques to prepare the dataset before training the models. This included data scaling, handling missing values, detecting and managing outliers, and other essential preprocessing steps.

Once the data was ready, I trained several classification models, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. My goal was to identify the most effective model for predicting heart disease.

To evaluate model performance, I used multiple accuracy assessment methods such as cross-validation. Additionally, I utilized the confusion matrix to check for potential overfitting. In the end, I selected the best-performing model with the optimal hyperparameters. In this case, the KNN model with 3 neighbors performed best without overfitting. While other models, such as random forests and logistic regression, achieved higher accuracy, they showed signs of overfitting, making KNN the most reliable choice for this dataset.
